excerpt: 'Palea and lemma are grass specific floral organs, and their identities to the typical floral organs in eudicots remains unclear. In the present study, we identified and characterized a defective body of palea (dbop) from ethyl methyl sulfonate mutagenesis lines of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare. The dbop mutant exhibited abnormal palea without the body of palea. By map-based cloning, the DBOP was narrowed down to a 68.9 kb interval on the long arm of chromosome 9. Sequencing result showed that there was G to A substitution and C to A substitution at the 245th and 383rd nucleotide of LOC_Os09g24480 coding sequence region, respectively. DBOP was found allelic to the RETARDED PALEA1 (REP1) gene which encoded a TCP family transcription factor. DBOP/REP1 might specify palea development by suppressing the expansion of the margin of palea.'
