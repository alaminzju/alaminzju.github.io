excerpt: 'Ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthase (Fd-GOGAT, EC 1.4.7.1) plays major roles in photorespiration and primary nitrogen assimilation. However, due to no mutant or knockdown lines of OsFd-GOGAT have been reported in rice (Oryza sativa L.), the contribution of OsFd-GOGAT to rice foliar nitrogen metabolism remains little up-to-date. Here, we isolated a rice premature leaf senescence mutant named gogat1, which was reduced in 67% of the total GOGAT enzyme activity in leaves. The gogat1 mutant exhibited chlorosis under natural condition, while showed less extent premature leaf senescence under low light treatment. The gogat1 locus was mapped to a 54.1 kb region on chromosome 7, and the sequencing of OsFd-GOGAT showed one substitution (A to T) at the 3017th nucleotide of the open reading frame, leading to the amino-acid substitution of leucine changed to histidine. The gogat1 mutant showed reduced seed setting rate, while the grain protein content in gogat1 mutant was significantly higher than that in wild type. Meanwhile, during the grain-filling stage, total amino acids in the up three leaves and the upmost internode were increased dramatically. The results in this study suggested that OsFd-GOGAT might participate in nitrogen remobilization during leaf senescence, which provides a potential way to improve nitrogen use efficiency in rice.'
