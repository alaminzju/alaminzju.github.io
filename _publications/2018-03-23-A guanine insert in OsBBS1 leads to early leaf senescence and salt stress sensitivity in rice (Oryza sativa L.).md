excerpt: 'Early leaf senescence can cause negative effects on rice yield, but the underlying molecular regulation is not fully understood. bilateral blade senescence 1 (bbs1), an early leaf senescence mutant with a premature senescence phenotype that occurs mainly performing at the leaf margins, was isolated from a rice mutant population generated by ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS) treatment. The mutant showed premature leaf senescence beginning at the tillering stage and exhibited severe symptoms at the late grain-filling stage. bbs1 showed accelerated dark-induced leaf senescence. The OsBBS1 gene was cloned by a map-based cloning strategy, and a guanine (G) insertion was found in the first exon of LOC_Os03g24930. This gene encodes a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase and was named OsRLCK109 in a previous study. Transgenic LOC_Os03g24930 knockout plants generated by a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy exhibited similar early leaf senescence phenotypes as did the bbs1 mutant, which confirmed that LOC_Os03g24930 was the OsBBS1 gene. OsBBS1/OsRLCK109 was expressed in all detected tissues and was predominantly expressed in the main vein region of mature leaves. The expression of OsBBS1 could be greatly induced by salt stress, and the bbs1 mutant exhibited hypersensitivity to salt stress. In conclusion, this is the first identification of OsRLCKs participating in leaf senescence and playing critical roles in the salt stress response in rice (Oryza sativa L.).'
