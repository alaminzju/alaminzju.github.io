excerpt: 'Gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping measures the
relationship between gene expressions and genotypic variations in a certain
chromosomal location. Most of the existing eQTL mapping algorithms are not
suitable for the identification of important genes related to human phenotypic
problems like a disease. However, SNP based fast eQTL mapping is suitable for
the identification of important genes related to human phenotypic problems. But,
the existing SNP based eQTL mapping is sensitive to outliers. In this paper, we
robustify the SNP based Fast eQTL mapping using outlier modification rule. For
outlier modification, we use the minimum β-divergence method. First, we detect
the outlier by β-weight function then we replace outlier data points by its
respective robust mean produced by the minimum β-divergence method. Then we
investigate the performance of the proposed method in a comparison of the
existing method using simulation study. Simulation results show that the proposed 
method performs better than traditional method in presence of outliers; otherwise
it keeps almost equal performance.'
