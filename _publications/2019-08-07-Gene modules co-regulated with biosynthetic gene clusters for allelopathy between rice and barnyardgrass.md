excerpt: 'Allelopathy is a central process in cropâ€“weed interactions and is mediated by the release of allelochemicals that result in adverse growth effects on one or the other plant in the interaction. The genomic mechanism for the biosynthesis of many critical allelochemicals is unknown but may involve the clustering of non-homologous biosynthetic genes involved in their formation and regulatory gene modules involved in controlling the coordinated expression within these gene clusters. In this study, we used the transcriptomes from mono- or co-cultured rice and barnyardgrass to investigate the nature of the gene clusters and their regulatory gene modules involved in the allelopathic interactions of these two plants. In addition to the already known biosynthetic gene clusters in barnyardgrass we identified three potential new clusters including one for quercetin biosynthesis and potentially involved in allelopathic interaction with rice. Based on the construction of gene networks, we identified one gene regulatory module containing hub transcription factors, significantly positively co-regulated with both the momilactone A and phytocassane clusters in rice. In barnyardgrass, gene modules and hub genes co-expressed with the gene clusters responsible for 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIMBOA) biosynthesis were also identified. In addition, we found three genes in barnyardgrass encoding indole-3-glycerolphosphate synthase that regulate the expression of the DIMBOA cluster. Our findings offer new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of biosynthetic gene clusters involved in allelopathic interactions between rice and barnyardgrass, and have potential implications in controlling weeds for crop protection.'
