Welcome! I am a postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Southern University of Science and Technology, College of Life Sciences, Department of Biology, Shenzhen, China](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/). I have completed my first postdoc in “Genomics and Bioinformatics” at [Zhejiang University, Institute of Bioinformatics, Hangzhou, China](http://ibi.zju.edu.cn/index.html/index.html). I have completed my Ph.D. from [Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). I have more than two years of practical experience in big data analysis (clinical data) using R and SAS programming as a “Statistical Programmer” at [Shafi Consultancy Ltd.](https://www.shaficonsultancy.com/), and more than three years of research experience as a “Postdoctoral Research Fellow”. 


My research work has been [published](publications) in prestigious journals such as "Front Genet, Int J Mol Sci, Plant Cell Reports, Genes, Mol Genet Genomics, and Gene”. I am working in the fields of Genetics, Computational Biology, and model development in the bioinformatics research field. I am seeking an opportunity to reinforce and diversify my skill set in the areas of Genomics and Bioinformatics as a Assist. Professor/ Research Assocaite.
